# Asset Cat [End of Development - No Future Updates]

Asset Cat is like Plex for video game assets. Providing a rich, user-friendly interface where you can catalogue and search all your assets. And even better, keep it in the cloud with DropBox so you can access across all your computers.

If your sick of browsing through folders to find the right asset for your game, then this  is the app for you.
